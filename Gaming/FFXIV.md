- Starting with the pandemonium questlines. I will write here a short summary of what is happening. 

We are in pandemonium a prison for things from Elpis. Something is off and we found out that some of the beasts are roaming free and we have to rain in them. 

The first thing todo is go to Labyrinthos. Claudien says that we have some memories from a party which we can access.. 

The current stepps I have to do is to gear up my RPR and the DRK to 600 for the new Raids. Also I dont reallyt cxare about other content.
