Kiali is an open-source service mesh observability and configuration tool, which provides visibility and insights into the<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> behavior of microservices running on a Kubernetes cluster.</mark>

Kiali is based on the Istio<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> service mesh</mark>, which is a technology for connecting, securing, and managing the communications between microservices. Istio provides features such as service discovery, load balancing, traffic routing, and fault tolerance, which are essential for building scalable and resilient applications.

Kiali integrates with Istio to provide a graphical user interface for viewing and managing the [[service mesh]]. It allows you to see the relationships between the different microservices, and provides detailed metrics and insights into their performance and behavior.

Kiali also provides tools for configuring and managing the service mesh, such as creating and modifying traffic policies, injecting faults and delays, and applying traffic shifting rules. This allows you to fine-tune the behavior of the service mesh, and experiment with different configurations to optimize the performance of your applications.

Overall, Kiali is a powerful and useful tool for monitoring and managing a service mesh running on Kubernetes. It provides valuable insights and visibility into the behavior of your microservices, and allows you to configure and control the service mesh to optimize the performance of your applications.
