This is a good reference - https://testing-library.com/docs/

Making the tests works is key. something I need to use: 

`import { cleanup, RenderResult, renderWithContext, userEvent } from "testUtils/react-testing";`

Add more information as I go on to these tests. 

### UserEvent
[UserEvent](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-user-event/)

`userEvent.type(HTML, value)` - Currently using this to insert number into the input
