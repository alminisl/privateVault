Define an abstract class in Typescript using the `abstract` keyword. Abstract classes are mainly for inheritance where other classes may derive from them. We cannot create an instance of an abstract class.

An abstract class typically includes one or more abstract methods or property declarations. The class which extends the abstract class must define all the abstract methods.
