More pipeline work!

Look at the other products and how they do it.

# 8.8.2022

Anxiety. Is the best word to describe this. 

Anyway, work related still working on the Pipelines and the Scripsts for the deployment. 

After some time I figure that my problem was that I did not include the Engine code. That engine code I'm working on now.

I have to create locally the proof of concept for this.. so lets start.

- [x] First of I will need to make a way to download the project artifacts
- [x] Try to automate the downloading of the artifacts

Making these changes is something I have still to figure out. The font here is a bit "bad" and stil have to figure that out on here.

# 15:23
**Successfully** made the DVD installation work on my Work pc.  
Now the job is to figure out how to automate this, fetching the artifacts and updating the files. 

Stepps I did: 
- Use the DVD link Ivan sent
- Open CMD with Admin Rights
- Go to the `install.cmd` 
- After install is finished run localhost:3000 / 8080 and the app should work
- also update the .env in the Engine folder

Current issues: 
- Bad Credentials, possible need to link the license with my user.

# 02/08/2022 09:22
