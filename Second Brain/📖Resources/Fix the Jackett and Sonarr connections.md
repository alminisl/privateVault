Both of those services are currently running on the RPI. 

I want to fix it now so that I can use the services on the RPI but save the data on my Synology NAS. [[linking PI and Synology]]

- Also look into moving the configurations from Synology to RPI. [[Move the configs]]

## Solution 

#issue #rpi #jakcett #sonarr

In the end i just installed everything on my RPI and not Synology.
