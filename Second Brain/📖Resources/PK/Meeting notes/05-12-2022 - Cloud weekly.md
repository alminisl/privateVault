## Meeting, general updates

- Updates from XC-an 
	- Communcation should be fine now

- CloudAMQP used instead of **MQTT**
- Access to the Services.. on Azure. 
- KTS - Probably not needed only if the Clients needs it. 
- How do we deploy the images? 
	- PKLHUB
		- Release name
		- Tagging on github 

Can we have helm charts which are optional? Like something that makes the helm chart start only one thing.. or should be make it more general and then create the deployments.

Write down best ways to configure that and how we want to use this Helm/terraform etc. Something where we can have multiple components and where we can configure what to start or not. 

**Grafana** - what metrics do we have and what do we need? 

**MQTT update with the other MQTT broker.**
