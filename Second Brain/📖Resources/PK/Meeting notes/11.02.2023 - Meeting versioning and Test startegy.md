- Old version and endpoints have to be tested - JMeter 
- Working with new Endpoints 
- Whats the priority for the new Endpoints? Should we focus on them?
	- They also don't have much new updates on the versions
	- We are a bit more ahead of the curve
	- Focus should be stability
	- If the new endpoints work - Work with them? 
	- General communicating with XC 
	- Stability and Functionality is the priority
	- Do we need update or not? 
	- Better communication for versions should we update to 8.3.x
		- We need Release notes :D 
	- Loadtest are important to test the load of the kubernetes cluster. 
	- Automate the tests - Jenkins and deployment
	- 8.3.0 - Can we test it? 
		- Should we test every endpoint or should we test the use cases? 
		- Just every endpoint 

# Conclusion 

Jmeter - Use case tests 
Jest - API endpoint tests
