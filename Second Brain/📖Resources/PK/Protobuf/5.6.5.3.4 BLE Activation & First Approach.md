## 5.6.5.3.4 BLE Activation & First Approach

Upon first approach after owner pairing over NFC is complete, device and vehicle shall establish Bluetooth LE bonding and offer passive entry or RKE experience for that approach.


### Summary 
The use case involves establishing a Bluetooth LE bonding between a device and a vehicle after owner pairing over NFC is complete. The SpaaK Module enables Passive Entry / RKE BLE advertisement with the vehicle BLE address (MAC) after which the device decodes the Vehicle MAC using the vehicle BLE IRK contained in tag 7F49 transferred during owner pairing. A BLE communication channel is established between SpaaK Module and the device, and SpaaK Module performs Standard Transaction. Once the first approach is complete, SpaaK informs GMA using Pass_through message, enabling Passive Entry and Passive Start.

Not really relevant for us as this describes the onboard components.
