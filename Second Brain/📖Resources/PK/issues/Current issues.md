>Write down issues with the local development or kubernetes and have a list of them here and maybe potential fixes. 


## What are the core issues we have ? 
- Figuring out how to connect to the registry to get/download the images sometimes we have the issue. 
- The secrets in the kubernetes cluster need to be named `acr-auth` 


## What are some nice to haves we can have related to the kubernetes and local dev cluster ?
