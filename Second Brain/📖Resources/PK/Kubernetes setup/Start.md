## Starting tooling for the kubernetes in the PK project

- **[[Basics]]** install, differs from System to system. 
	- For example, I've used: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kubernetes 
	- This is guide for Manjaro 
- **[[Minikube]]** - Lightweight kube implementation
- [[microk8s]] - even lighter kube implementation
- **[[Helm]]** - Used this guide - https://phoenixnap.com/kb/create-helm-chart, official docu - https://helm.sh/docs/howto/charts_tips_and_tricks/ 
- **[[Kubectl]]** - Basic usage: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/list-all-running-container-images/ 
- [[Kind]] - Simple kubernetes cluster manager

## How do I see what I've started? 

First and hardest step is to create a Kubernetes Cluster locally and make sure you have a kubeconfig. 

[[Commands]] - to see what or where is deployed and how

## Setting up networking

Install istio like it is shown in the istio website. 

~~Istio is the main building block for the networking. We need to install the `istioctl`
and then `istioctl install` to enable the istio services. 



**Very important part:**

to enable the "injection" of containers into the pod, which istio needs (the `istio-proxy`) we need to use `kubectl label namespace <name> istio-injection=enabled`

 kc get ns default --show-labels - to check if its working

services and pods are connected via labels.
