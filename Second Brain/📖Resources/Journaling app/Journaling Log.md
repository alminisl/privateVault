Thinking about a pivot. So the journaling app should do What it already does, however I will created it from scratch. The idea is to make it better with DraculaUI. The current app is a little bit complex. I also want to make a landing page which is a bit more user friendlier. Also the approach I'm making is probably mobile first on this one. I want to make it look good on mobile and the desktop app should be just the after thought. 

The biggest problem to solve is "offline". I want the app to be 100% in the users hands on what they can do. So when I write a note and make something I want it to be synced from device to device. Nothing more nothing less. However this seems to be the biggest pain point. Also I want to have something like this in obsidian to write markdown and it applies the markdown immidately so thats the project I will pursue for now. 

- Feature to have: Image import and things like that. So day one just better.

Made a bunch of changed to the project. I've successfully migrated from Blitz to T3 app. Now I'm working on fixing the missing features.

Most of the CRUS stuff is done I think I will now proceed to update the [[TODO]] 

Will be back with more info. 

I failed to document every step now I figure but I will try to fix that now.

Started the effort for the migration. [[T3 app migration]] So far so good and everything is working as planned. 

The one thing that caused issues is the WSWYG editor which now is the tiptap.

I have to figure out what kind of cope of features I want for the MVP and what I want to deploy and release. 

So something to think about is that. look at [Planning](joplin://x-callback-url/openNote?id=07e45061ec8b43459a9194b8b40ff716)
