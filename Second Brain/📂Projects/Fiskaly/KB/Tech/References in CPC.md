- First step stepping thru the code and checking out what is suspiciouse.. 
- The issue was that the referneces have to live in the HEAD of the object not the root. 

### Reference setup 

- have to add them to the HEAD of the TRANSACTIONS 
- added the transaction tx_id from the newly created transaction and its Tx_id 

All transactions and references are saved int othe DB 

Next step is the Export.
