- Something new and interesting that happened is that I've learned that the date/time stamps are not MILISECONDS but SECONDS. 
  
- This is a bit weird but Will have to get used to this.  
some resource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time 

Unix time but in seconds.

The timestamp should be 2016-09-27T17:00:01 and thats what I should use in the system. 

- There should be a way to transform the dates and not change everything around them. 
- First I need to revert everything then i will know what to do next. 

currently the conversions are not good. I somehow get the wrong date. I will try to fix this today if not I will try to do it tomorrow as a first thing and focus maximum on it.
