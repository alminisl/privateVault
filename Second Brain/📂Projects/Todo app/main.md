# Idea

Tick tick / todoist clone with calendar sync.

Whit should be a simple sideproject which should be also open source on github and provide me with some basic open source repo stuff. The main goal is to learn to use [[serverless]], [[vite]], [[mqtt]], [[realtime updates]] and so on.. so mostly backend technologies and stacks. for my initial mvp, I want to have server - client relation / architecture in place for my whole app. So for now no offline version. Make it simple and intuitive is the only goal for the frontend.
