We can find the [[Second Brain/üñ•Ô∏è Coding/Coding/Layer Presets]] component in the Components

- Ask about step - 7. A flag for whether to display layers that are not visible (current behavior is to leave them in the layer list so they could be toggled on if desired, but some use cases want them hidden) Should this be a global flag? #todo #feature

Alle layer die nich visible sind, alle raus sind oder ?
