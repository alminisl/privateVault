this is a small project I want to start to rewrite our entire TBE into NestJS. 

Naming: Nimble - quick and light in movement or action; agile / (of the mind) able to think and understand quickly.

the current concensus is unclear if we want to use the existing TBE or use a new one. My idea is to make new one for the following reasons: 

- Maintanability
- Ease of use 
- New colleagues will probably know TS / Nest / Node 
- Faster iterations

**Suggestion**

Keep up both TBEs, write the new one in paralel to the old one. 

- Have to analyze what code is needed and what features do we want to implement. The basic stuff is just CRUD to the DB and MQTT to communicate, rest should be totally replaced? 
  
- Think of the problem in smaller chunks, make 1 endpoint and test it somehow
	- Current idea is to test it out with Postman collections
