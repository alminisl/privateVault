## Background

This is a small project which is being inspired by the trip to turkey where I just saw a small book store with book outside in a shelf where they are written only small descriptions about the book. 
So that is where my idea comes from and where I made a smiliar website where you can see list of books and hashtags for those books. 

The thing I wanted from this project is to learn more about astro js and get to know that technology which maybe be one of my favorite frameworks. 

## Tech 

I've opted to use open library API and Astro.build with Tailwind and TS.

I've made this work and deployed to netlify. 

## Goal 

Make it easy to find books you might know or want to read using those hashtags and tags. 


## Current issues
- Design seems to be the best issue for now 
- cant see images when deployed. #blog #idea 
	- I should make a blogpost on how to solve this issue and why it appeared. 
	- Very weird thing that happened with the astro thingy
